# DECIMER
The official project page of DECIMER: Deep Learning for Chemical Image Recognition

## Description
The project aims to develop methods to employ deep learning to recognize and interpret chemical structure from images in the printed and online literature with the aim of re-discovering scientific facts about natural products and their meta-data. The method, of course, will be generically applicable to most organic chemistry publications.

### The project is co-supervised by,

- Prof. Christoph Steinbeck, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena.
- Prof. Achim Zielesny, Westphalian University of Applied Sciences, Recklinghausen.
