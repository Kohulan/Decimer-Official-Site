# DECIMER
The official project page of DECIMER: Deep Learning for Chemical Image Recognition

## Description
The project aims to develop methods to employ deep learning to recognize and interpret chemical structure from images in the printed and online literature with the aim of re-discovering scientific facts about natural products and their meta-data. The method, of course, will be generically applicable to most organic chemistry publications.

### The project is co-supervised by,

- [Prof. Christoph Steinbeck](https://cheminf.uni-jena.de/members/steinbeck/), Friedrich Schiller University, Jena.
- [Prof. Achim Zielesny](https://www.w-hs.de/service/informationen-zur-person/person/zielesny/), Westphalian University of Applied Sciences, Recklinghausen.
